Web3 Wallet for Salesforce, powered by Circle programmable wallets, will be the first native crypto wallet for corporations that relies upon traditional corporate systems for authentication and authorization, supporting the rapid adoption of USDC and EURC payments in the US and EU respectively.
A corporate IT native Web3 Wallet will store the private keys in their existing infrastructure, in this case Salesforce, while utilizing their already in-place authentication systems and authorizations. The company will be able to grant read, write, and execute permissions on the Web3 assets without leaving the environment they are comfortable with.
